# DSA_Projects_Parmeet
This repository contains one mini-project and one major-project implemented in C++ using basic Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

# 🚀 Projects

# 🔐 1. OTP Generator + Validator
## 📌 Features
- Generates numeric OTP using arrays and `rand()`
- Takes user input and validates OTP
- Uses arrays, functions, loops, conditionals

📁 Path: `C++/otp_generator_validator.cpp`

# 🚆 2. Mumbai Local Route Planner (Western Line)
A simple and interactive C++ console application that finds the shortest route between Mumbai local stations on the **Western Line** using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

## 📌 Features

- Choose a **source** and **destination** station by index.
- Displays the **shortest path** (in terms of number of stations).
- Estimates **travel time** (assuming 2 minutes per station).
- Realistic and readable output for better user experience.
- Implemented with basic **DSA (Graphs + Dijkstra)** in C++.
